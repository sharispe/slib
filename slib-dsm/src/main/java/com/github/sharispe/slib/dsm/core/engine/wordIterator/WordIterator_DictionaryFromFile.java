/**
 * Implementation of the interface {@link WordIterator} considering a given
 * vocabulary - only the words in the vocabulary will be returned. As an example
 * considering the following sentence "Twenty years from now you will be more
 * disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do, so
 * throw off the bowlines, sail away from safe harbor, catch the trade winds in
 * your sails. Explore, Dream, Discover. –Mark Twain" and considering the
 * following vocabulary [things, Mark Twain, years, random, safe, sail] word
 * size of 3 the iterator will return five words: (1) years, (2) things, (3)
 * sail, (4) safe, (5) Mark Twain.
