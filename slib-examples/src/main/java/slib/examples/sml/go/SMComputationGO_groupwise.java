/**
 *
 * Example of a Semantic measure computation using the Semantic Measures
 * Library. In this snippet we estimate the similarity of two genes annotated by
 * concepts (terms) defined in the Gene Ontology. The Gene Ontology is expressed
 * in OBO format. The similarity is estimated using an indirect groupwise
 * measure based on: Lin's pairwise measure, Best Match Average aggregation
 * strategy.
 *
 * More information at http://www.semantic-measures-library.org/
 *
 * Note that you can set the LOG level in specified in log4j.xml, e.g. in root
 * element, change value="INFO" to value="DEBUG"
